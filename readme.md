## Running
If you have a private repo, you need to add a personal Github Token by clicking the extension icon in the top right of the browser.

You can create a token by going to [your github profile -> settings -> developer settings -> personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Label it something like 'github printer' so you remember what it's for, and check the Repo box to give it full repo permission.

 - Add them as a comma seperated list, without spaces `'org1,org2'`
